# Fontworks Font Finder
Finds the most similar font in the Fontworks library of fonts, pulled from all available sources.

Would actually work on any fonts I think, but is optimized for Fontworks fonts, so user beware.

This is the most spagetti-code project I've made, but it works somewhat, which is more that I can say for some of my projects on here
